# Projectors

A `Projector` implements a data projection, it takes in an input and produces zero or more outputs to a provided `Sink`.
Projectors implement the core logic of a projection, for example selection of entities of interest, using sinks to
provide further processing of their outputs. A projector is strongly typed so, you might have a `Projector<Graph,
Entity>` that projects from RDF Graphs to Entities.

A `ProjectorDriver` automates the connection of the various core concepts into a runnable application. It takes in an
[`EventSource`](../event-sources/index.md), a `Projector` and a [`Sink`](../sinks/index.md) and automates the polling of
events from the event source and passing those through the projector and onto the `Sink`.

# Interface

The interface for a `Projector` consists of a single method `project(TInput input, Sink<TOutput> output)` that should be
called for each input. This method should implement the projection logic and for each output produced call `send()` on
the provided output `Sink`.

`ProjectorDriver` is a concrete class rather than an interface, it implements the `Runnable` interface meaning it can be
run by calling the `run()` method. Preferably this is done by putting the instance onto a separate thread. It also
provides a `cancel()` method that can be used to tell the driver to stop and abort further processing.

# Usage

A `Projector` is not typically used directly but rather via a `ProjectorDriver` like so:

```java
EventSource<Graph> source = createEventSource();
Projector<Graph, Graph> projector = new NoOpProjector<>();

ProjectorDriver driver 
    = new ProjectorDriver(source, Duration.ofSeconds(30), Duration.ofSeconds(10), projector,
                          ()->new NullSink<Graph>(), -1, -1, 100_000);

// Create a background thread to run the driver adding a shutdown hook that cancels it when the JVM is shutdown
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
Future<?> future = executor.submit(driver);
Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(() -> driver.cancel()));

// Wait for the driver to finish, or the user to Ctrl+C the application
try {
    future.get();
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    LOGGER.warn("Interrupted while waiting for projection to finish");
} catch (ExecutionException e) {
    LOGGER.error("Unexpected error in projection: {}", e.getCause());
}
```

As can be seen a `ProjectorDriver` takes a number of parameters, see the [Driver documentation](driver.md) for more
details.

# Dependency

`Projector` implementations are primarily provided by the `projectors-core` module which can be depended on from Maven
like so:

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.telicent.smart-caches</groupId>
    <artifactId>projectors-core</artifactId>
    <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```

Where `VERSION` is the desired version, see the top level [README](../../README.md) in this repository for that
information. This module also provides the [`Sink` API](../sinks/index.md).

You will also find additional implementations of this interface in other modules such as the [Entity Collection
API](https://github.com/telicent-io/smart-cache-search/blob/main/docs/entity-collector/index.md) which will require
dependencies on those modules.

`ProjectorDriver` is provided by a separate `projector-driver` module which can be depended on from Maven like so:

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.telicent.smart-caches</groupId>
    <artifactId>projector-driver</artifactId>
    <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```

# Implementations

The `projectors-core` only provides a single implementation, the `NoOpProjector`. This implementation simply passes the
input directly to the output sink as-is. The `entity-collector` module provides the
[`EntityCentricProjector`](https://github.com/telicent-io/smart-cache-search/blob/main/docs/entity-collector/projector.
md) which is the only other concrete implementation currently.

The `projector-driver` module provides the [`ProjectorDriver`](driver.md) which has its own dedicated documentation.
