/**
 * Represents an action that you only want to run at most once within any given interval.
 * <p>
 * For example you might want to log a warning when performance drops below a certain threshold <strong>BUT</strong>
 * don't want to flood the logs with this warning and instead emit it only periodically.  Similarly you might want to
 * periodically compute some expensive statistic.  Using this class allows callers to not worry about controlling when
 * the action will run and just focus on the action itself.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This is effectively an implementation of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket">leaky bucket rate
 * limiter</a> using the "as a meter" semantics i.e. if the action has already occurred during the period then it is
 * simply skipped.
