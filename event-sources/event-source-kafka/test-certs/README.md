# Kafka Test Certificates

This directory contains helper scripts uses to generate certificates necessary to test Kafka SSL functionality and
verify our code can communicate with secure Kafka clusters successfully.

It contains:

- `generateCerts.sh` - A script that generates the necessary Certificates, Trust and Key Stores to enable SSL in Kafka.
- `openssl-ca.cnf` - A `openssl` configuration file necessary to generate and sign certificates correctly.
- `runSecureKafkaBroker.sh` - A script for running a secured Kafka broker (using the certificates generated by
  `generateCerts.sh`) as a standalone container outside of tests for developers to use.

After `generateCerts.sh` has been run it will contain various other files that represent the test certificates, these
are explicitly `.gitignore`'d and **MUST NOT** be committed into `git`

## Usage from Tests

See the [Kafka Testing](../../../docs/event-sources/kafka.md#testing-secure-clusters) documentation for details on how
to use this in your own tests and other projects.
